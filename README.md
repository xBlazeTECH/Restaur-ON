Introducing waitress.js
=======================

A node.js based system for resturants that handles reservations, table arrangements, orders, bills, and texts/emails when you food is ready. It is very simple to set up, but I do not have any setup instructions or tutorials yet as the system of setup is ever changing. Once I get a release that does all of the things specified in the TO-DO list, then I should be able to make documentation.

**This program is in it's developmental stages and has not yet been designed to do any or all of the thing specified above, so please avoid critizism until it is formally released. Thank you!**

To-Do List
----------
[ ] Table Arrangements

[ ] Billing and Payment

[ ] Reservations (Call In)

[ ] User Authentication with Diff. Roles

[ ] Calls when seat is ready
